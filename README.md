# Prediction of Bike Rental Demand Based on Various Factors

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict bike rental demand based on various factors such as weather conditions, holidays, and seasonality. The analysis uses a dataset containing daily bike rental data spanning two years (2011-2012) with 731 data points and 16 indicators.

## Motivation
Predicting bike rental patterns can significantly benefit bike-sharing programs and rental companies by:
- Improving demand forecasting
- Optimizing resource allocation
- Enhancing customer satisfaction
- Increasing operational efficiency

## Tools and Techniques Used
1. **Programming Language**: R
2. **Libraries**: 
   - ggplot2 (for data visualization)
   - Others (not explicitly mentioned, but likely include dplyr, caret, randomForest)
3. **Data Analysis Techniques**:
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Summary Statistics
   - Data Visualization (various plots)
   - Outlier Analysis
   - Correlation Analysis
4. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - Linear Regression
   - Decision Tree Regression
   - Random Forest Regression
5. **Model Evaluation Techniques**:
   - Cross-validation (3-fold)
   - R-squared (Coefficient of Determination)
   - RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
   - Residual Analysis

## Key Findings
1. Bike rental demand is highest during summer and fall seasons.
2. Weekdays show higher demand compared to weekends.
3. Clear weather conditions correlate with increased bike rentals.
4. The year 2012 saw higher rental numbers compared to 2011.
5. Temperature and year are the most important variables in predicting bike rental demand.

## Best Performing Model
The Random Forest Regression model outperformed Linear Regression and Decision Tree models, explaining 86.73% of the variance in the target variable.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in predicting bike rental demand. The insights gained can help bike-sharing services optimize their operations and improve user experience. Future work could involve incorporating more recent data or exploring additional features to enhance prediction accuracy.
